Bit depth, when speaking about video, refers to the amount of information stored for images that appear on screen. This bit depth information is stored for each bit plane. For color video, this bit depth covers three planes: typically Red/Green/Blue for RGB or Lightness/Blue-difference/Red-difference for YcbCr.

A generally recommended bit depth for standard definition video is 8 bit. A bit depth of 8 means that there are 256 possible colors available for a particular pixel, just like early video game systems were referred to as having “8 bit color.” Although 256 colors is not very much, it is important to remember that for video, the bit depth number is applied to all three components of the color space. So when this concept of 8 bit (depth) with 256 possible colors is conveyed per each video plane, it means that 8 bit video is representing a color range of 256x256x256, or 16,777,216 shades of color and lightness. Similarly, 10 bit represents a color range of 1024x1024x1024 and 16 bit represents a color depth range of 4096x4096x4096. All of these numbers add up to way more colors than humans are capable of perceiving.
There are reasons to preserve content above that which a human is capable of visually perceiving, and that relates to material that may have value in being color-graded in the future or manipulated in any way. Because of this, some archives prefer using a higher resolution.
