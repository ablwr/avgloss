For a color space like YUV and YCbCr, the representation of color is separated by storing data on
the brightness of the pixel (the Y value, representing luma) and the two other parts representing the
color (referred to as chroma). Using YCbCr as an example, Y represents the luma, and Cb and Cr
represent the blue-difference and red-difference of an image.

YUV and YCbCr are closely related but different color spaces. They are often used interchangeably,
but experts appreciate the nuances between the two. YUV is used specifically for the analogue
encoding of data, like with pre-digital broadcast television, and YCbCr is the technology used in
digital video.
