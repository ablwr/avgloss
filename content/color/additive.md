RGB is the de-facto color space for digital spaces in general, not just video. For a color space like
RGB, there are three essential colors and they all convene in brightness, with cumulative color
creating pure white at the centre, and dark tones at the edges. Each pixel is represented by a
percentage of red, green, and blue. If all three components are at 100%, the color of the pixel will
be white. If all three components are at 0%, the pixel will be black.
