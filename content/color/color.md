Color is a component crucial to video, and replicating human vision in analogue or digital media has
been a highly complex science. Color is represented by the concept of color spaces, which is how
color is represented within an image. Different color spaces are used in video materials,
depending on their source or any conversions that have occurred. Care must be taken if converting
from one color space format to another, because there are technical nuances that can create a
poor-quality or inaccurate image. For a deeper look into color, see Charles Poynton’s A Technical
Introduction to Digital Video, cited in the Further Reading section.
These are some of the most common color spaces to be aware of when working in video
preservation:
• RGB
• YUV
• YCbCr
There are many other color spaces in use, but these are the three major ones. Color spaces follow
two different conceptual models: additive color spaces and luma/chroma color spaces.
