Video is made up of a series of image frames (and sometimes audio frames). Each image frame is made up of pixels. The height and width of video is usually described as the pixel height and pixel width. While pixels seem like a simple concept, there is a lot more going on behind the scenes than one may assume. This section will cover a few examples of that: chroma subsampling, pixel bit depth, and pixel aspect ratios.
