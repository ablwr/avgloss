Timecodes are a tricky subject but crucial to archival video, especially when working broadcast media. The purpose of timecodes is simple enough: timecodes assign a number to each frame. This follows the format of hours, minutes, seconds, and frames (HH:MM:SS;FF). Timecodes hold a lot of significance especially in video production environments. 
Timecodes can be "burnt" into the frames themselves, meaning they are irremovable and appear on screen for each frame. Otherwise, timecode data is stored within the file, either as part of the frame or attached as a separate track. For timecodes that are stored as separate tracks, it is important to make sure this data is saved when doing digitization or transcoding work, because it can easily be skipped or removed.

Here are the most common timecode formats to be aware of when working with preservation material:  

* BITC: Burnt-In Time Code, data that is stored as part of the image frame. This cannot be removed.
* LTC: Linear Timecode, data stored as a separate audio track.
* VITC: Vertical Interval Time Code, data is stored in the "vertical blanking interval" of a video track. This means the data is stored as part of the video stream, on a single non-visible scan line.
