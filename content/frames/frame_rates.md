Video files also have sampling rates, but are more frequently characterized by their frame rates.
Frame rates determine how fast things go. Before the advent of sound-on-film, when soundwaves
would be printed alongside image frames, there was no standard for the number of frames per
second that a piece of media should be set at and replayed. For film captured via hand-cranked
devices, the frame rate could vary depending on how quickly or slowly the cameraperson was
winding the film at the time of capture. Generally, the frame rate of silent-era film was 18 fps
(frames per second). This matters when film is digitized, because it is important to respect the
original frame rate and not have film appear to be ‘sped up’.
Part of the reason why bad transfers of silent film can appear to be moving faster than the natural,
captured movement is that when sound on film arrived, it set frame rates to the standard of 24 fps.
This was the standard for film for most of its lifetime (1920s–2000s), and only recently in the 21st
century have filmmakers been experimenting with frame rates higher than this.
Pragmatic Audiovisual Preservation

In the context of audiovisual files, audio frames consist of all the audio samples taken during the
interval of the video frame.Frame rate speeds have often depended on the two major standards, NTSC and PAL. NTSC (National
Television Standards Committee) is the standard broadcast format in the United States, and PAL
(Phase Alternating Line) is the standard broadcast format in Europe and Asia. For NTSC material, the
frame rate for video is 29.97 fps. For PAL, it is 25 fps. Similar to silent film being run as sound film, a
PAL video on an NTSC television will be jerky or slow as a result of using the wrong standard. These
standards were developed based on electrical power systems, which differ between regions.
These are all important considerations when working with digitized moving image material. For
digital video, frame rates are much more varied, sometimes even within formats. Digital cameras
from the past 20 years commonly offer the user the possibility of choosing a frame rate across
several standard options.
