Aspect ratios determine the width and height of an image and how it should be displayed. The
aspect ratio dimensions are commonly expressed with two numbers separated by a colon (x:y), but
can be displayed in two different styles. In the first style, 1 is the height of the image and the first
number is the width in relation to the height, with 1 as the base. For example, an aspect ratio of 2:1
means that the image is twice as wide as it is high. But it is also common to see aspect ratios in an
easier-to-read format such as 4:3. The aspect ratios of 4:3 and 1.33:1 are the same, just represented
differently, depending on whether one wants to represent the aspect ratio with the easier-to-
understand fraction, or consistently use 1 as the base height. They are used interchangeably, but
some numbers break down cleanly and others donâ€™t have an easy fraction. For example, 4:3 and
16:9 are easier to remember and type than the way their ratio breaks down in relation to 1 (1.33:1
and 1.77:1, respectively, with the trailing decimal of the first number continuing into infinity). A
widescreen ratio like 2.35:1 is only going to break down to 47:20, which is not more pleasant to say
than 2.35:1. It is typical for the easier-to-read fraction to be used except when comparing aspect
ratios , and then it becomes easier to understand which aspect ratios are wider than others when
they all start from the same base height number.
