Color is represented by the concept of color spaces, which is how\ncolor is represented within an image. Different color spaces are used in video materials,\ndepending on their source or any conversions that have occurred. Care must be taken if converting\nfrom one color space format to another, because there are technical nuances that can create a\npoor-quality or inaccurate image. For a deeper look into color, see Charles Poynton’s A Technical\nIntroduction to Digital Video, cited in the Further Reading section.  </p>\n<p>These are some of the most common color spaces to be aware of when working in video\npreservation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RGB</li>\n<li>YUV</li>\n<li>YCbCr</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many other color spaces in use, but these are the three major ones. Color spaces follow\ntwo different conceptual models: additive color spaces and luma/chroma color spaces.</p>","fields":{"section":null,"collection":{"id":"color","title":"Color","fields":{"slug":"/collections/color"}}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Color","date":"2020-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","modifiedDate":null,"description":"covers color spaces and more.","author":{"id":"ablwr","name":"Ashley Blewer","avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAABAQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCBAX/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAYQtOpA6WmYzGV//xAAbEAACAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABAwACIREEEv/aAAgBAQABBQInCJ8GbzCRbFJFp61VXAmvP//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQIf/aAAgBAwEBPwHWE//EABYRAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEf/aAAgBAgEBPwEj/8QAHBAAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQERJBMVFh/9oACAEBAAY/Auo5NDt1F2xY7sXqP//EABwQAAMAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESExQXGhwf/aAAgBAQABPyFvyWhiWxu4GGDFiDSofo0hXS+oWNV6pZZwPw//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEGQAfv/EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABERD/2gAIAQMBAT8QrCvEP//EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESH/2gAIAQIBAT8QazSBlP/EAB4QAQACAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESFBUXExYZHB/9oACAEBAAE/EHIwhKAF3mOl8nNHyKYY0hNZB1iIi+UcW8KwxqOAZeVVsPyUesSXFUHqBMmzLKFC6n//2Q==","width":100,"height":100,"src":"/avgloss/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/b315d/ashley.jpg","srcSet":"/avgloss/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/b315d/ashley.jpg 1x,\n/avgloss/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/dcd9a/ashley.jpg 1.5x,\n/avgloss/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/8295c/ashley.jpg 2x"}}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/color/color/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2584066095","694178885"]}
