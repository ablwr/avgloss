Using YCbCr as an example, Y represents the luma, and Cb and Cr\nrepresent the blue-difference and red-difference of an image.\nYUV and YCbCr are closely related but different colour spaces. They are often used interchangeably,\nbut experts appreciate the nuances between the two. YUV is used specifically for the analogue\nencoding of data, like with pre-digital broadcast television, and YCbCr is the technology used in\ndigital video.</p>","fields":{"section":null,"collection":{"id":"color","title":"Color","fields":{"slug":"/collections/color"}}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Luma/chroma","date":"2020-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","modifiedDate":null,"description":"Luma/chroma","author":{"id":"ablwr","name":"Ashley Blewer","avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":100,"height":100,"src":"/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/b315d/ashley.jpg","srcSet":"/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/b315d/ashley.jpg 1x,\n/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/dcd9a/ashley.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/8295c/ashley.jpg 2x"}}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/color/luma-chroma/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2584066095","694178885"]}
