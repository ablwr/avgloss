Before the advent of sound-on-film, when soundwaves\nwould be printed alongside image frames, there was no standard for the number of frames per\nsecond that a piece of media should be set at and replayed. For film captured via hand-cranked\ndevices, the frame rate could vary depending on how quickly or slowly the cameraperson was\nwinding the film at the time of capture. Generally, the frame rate of silent-era film was 18 fps\n(frames per second). This matters when film is digitized, because it is important to respect the\noriginal frame rate and not have film appear to be ‘sped up’.\nPart of the reason why bad transfers of silent film can appear to be moving faster than the natural,\ncaptured movement is that when sound on film arrived, it set frame rates to the standard of 24 fps.\nThis was the standard for film for most of its lifetime (1920s–2000s), and only recently in the 21st\ncentury have filmmakers been experimenting with frame rates higher than this.\nPragmatic Audiovisual Preservation\n10\nIn the context of audiovisual files, audio frames consist of all the audio samples taken during the\ninterval of the video frame.Frame rate speeds have often depended on the two major standards, NTSC and PAL. NTSC (National\nTelevision Standards Committee) is the standard broadcast format in the United States, and PAL\n(Phase Alternating Line) is the standard broadcast format in Europe and Asia. For NTSC material, the\nframe rate for video is 29.97 fps. For PAL, it is 25 fps. Similar to silent film being run as sound film, a\nPAL video on an NTSC television will be jerky or slow as a result of using the wrong standard. These\nstandards were developed based on electrical power systems, which differ between regions.\nThese are all important considerations when working with digitized moving image material. For\ndigital video, frame rates are much more varied, sometimes even within formats. Digital cameras\nfrom the past 20 years commonly offer the user the possibility of choosing a frame rate across\nseveral standard options.</p>","fields":{"section":null,"collection":{"id":"frames","title":"Frames","fields":{"slug":"/collections/frames"}}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Frame rates","date":"2020-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","modifiedDate":null,"description":"Frame rates","author":{"id":"ablwr","name":"Ashley Blewer","avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":100,"height":100,"src":"/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/b315d/ashley.jpg","srcSet":"/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/b315d/ashley.jpg 1x,\n/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/dcd9a/ashley.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/8295c/ashley.jpg 2x"}}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/frames/frame_rates/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2584066095","694178885"]}
