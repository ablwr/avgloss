The\naspect ratio dimensions are commonly expressed with two numbers separated by a colon (x:y), but\ncan be displayed in two different styles. In the first style, 1 is the height of the image and the first\nnumber is the width in relation to the height, with 1 as the base. For example, an aspect ratio of 2:1\nmeans that the image is twice as wide as it is high. But it is also common to see aspect ratios in an\neasier-to-read format such as 4:3. The aspect ratios of 4:3 and 1.33:1 are the same, just represented\ndifferently, depending on whether one wants to represent the aspect ratio with the easier-to-\nunderstand fraction, or consistently use 1 as the base height. They are used interchangeably, but\nsome numbers break down cleanly and others don’t have an easy fraction. For example, 4:3 and\n16:9 are easier to remember and type than the way their ratio breaks down in relation to 1 (1.33:1\nand 1.77:1, respectively, with the trailing decimal of the first number continuing into infinity). A\nwidescreen ratio like 2.35:1 is only going to break down to 47:20, which is not more pleasant to say\nthan 2.35:1. It is typical for the easier-to-read fraction to be used except when comparing aspect\nratios , and then it becomes easier to understand which aspect ratios are wider than others when\nthey all start from the same base height number.</p>","fields":{"section":null,"collection":{"id":"frames","title":"Frames","fields":{"slug":"/collections/frames"}}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Aspect ratios","date":"2020-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","modifiedDate":null,"description":"Aspect ratio","author":{"id":"ablwr","name":"Ashley Blewer","avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":100,"height":100,"src":"/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/b315d/ashley.jpg","srcSet":"/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/b315d/ashley.jpg 1x,\n/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/dcd9a/ashley.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/8295c/ashley.jpg 2x"}}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/frames/aspect_ratios/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2584066095","694178885"]}
