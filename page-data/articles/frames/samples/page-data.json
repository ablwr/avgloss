Samples are values at a specific point in time. Audio is often described by its sampling rate, generally presented as samples per second. This is usually displayed in Hertz (e.g. 96 kHz) but could also be written out fully (e.g. 96,000).\nHere are some common audio sampling rates:\n• 8 kHz: the general sampling rate for telephone transmission\n• 44.1 kHz: the sampling rate for audio CDs\n• 48 kHz: the standard audio sampling rate used in video equipment\n• 96 kHz: the general recommendation for preservation audio\nIn the context of audiovisual files, audio frames consist of all of the audio samples taken during the interval of the video frame.</p>","fields":{"section":null,"collection":{"id":"frames","title":"Frames","fields":{"slug":"/collections/frames"}}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Samples","date":"2020-01-02T00:00:00.000Z","modifiedDate":null,"description":"Samples","author":{"id":"ablwr","name":"Ashley Blewer","avatar":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":100,"height":100,"src":"/avgloss/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/b315d/ashley.jpg","srcSet":"/avgloss/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/b315d/ashley.jpg 1x,\n/avgloss/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/dcd9a/ashley.jpg 1.5x,\n/avgloss/static/06a108fad756867f6fd9431e1cc4fd4b/8295c/ashley.jpg 2x"}}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/frames/samples/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2584066095","694178885"]}
